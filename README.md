The Gamebuilders group submission for the 2014 Global Student Game Developer Competition.


Gameplay Overview
-----------------

The game will be a side-scrolling platformer shooter where the player controls a single pidgeon holding a vine in its beak. The player needs to advance through the level in order to rescue its friend, which is another pidgeon with a unique ability. There are 4 pidgeons to save total, each with their own ability (so 4 levels total). There will also be a boss battle at the end, once the player has control of all 5 pidgeons. The level will scroll from left to right automatically, but the player is still able to choose where they are on the screen.


Controls
--------

W,A,S,D for movement. The player controls his pidgeon and up to one other pidgeon (that has been unlocked) simultaneously.

Pidgeons will shoot their basic attacks automatically.

Space for partner pidgeon's special attack (which is on a cooldown)


Pidgeons
--------

Gray Pidgeon: Basic pidgeon. Always actively under control of player. Has no special abilities.
Red Pidgeon: Fire pidgeon. Shoots fireballs that burn obstacles.
Blue Pidgeon: Ice pidgeon. Shoots ice shards that freeze enemies and moving obstacles.
Purple Pidgeon: Shield pidgeon. Doesn't have much firepower, but has a shield that can be used on cooldown.
Gold Pidgeon: Warrior pidgeon. Has a ton of firepower. Ability damages all enemies on the screen.


Level Design
------------
Level 1: Player saves Red Pidgeon. Level is very simple with no crazy obstacles. Kinda like a tutorial level
Level 2: Player saves Blue Pidgeon. Level contains fire-vulnerable enemies, and wooden barriers that can be burned (in addition to Level 1 mechanics)
Level 3: Player saves Purple Pidgeon. Level contains fast-moving obstacles that can be frozen and enemies that are vulnerable to ice (in addition to Level 2 mechanics)
Level 4: Player saves Gold Pidgeon. Level contains unavoidable attacks (such as a big wave of something) that must be countered with purple pidgeon (in addition to Level 3 mechanics)
Boss Level: Level contains a lot of enemies that must be countered by gold pidgeon (in addition to Level 4 mechanics)


 Misc Notes
----------

* If time, make it so each pidgeon modifies the player's shooting in some way.
